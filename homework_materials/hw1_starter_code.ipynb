He built the time machine but as he figured to manipulate it accordingly, it played cat and mouse mentality with him (as if it really occurs) by jumping back a fourth year, second month, third day until chaos rules this contorted sort of timeline.

However, it quizzes the scientist and the time machine. The scientist tried to breaking in and busting open the time machine right away but it didn’t help at all. Quickly he sensed the scientist’s blunder and then cut the chain. Whilst the time machine nudged away and being mashed time up, the scientist seems rather unconcerned knowing that one of his kind is here. He flipped the switch and left..
